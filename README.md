# NLP-transformer

## 🧭 Project Overview

The **Transformer Toolkit** provides a unified interface for working with modern NLP tasks using Hugging Face–compatible transformer models.  
It supports four primary functions:

### ✍️ Text Generation
Autoregressive generation of creative or structured text — ideal for story completion, dialogue systems, and code generation.

### 📰 Summarization
Abstractive summarization of long documents into concise, coherent summaries using models like BART or T5.

### 🌍 Translation
Sequence-to-sequence translation between multiple languages powered by multilingual models such as mBART or M2M100.

### ❓ Question Answering
Both extractive and generative question answering from text documents — for knowledge retrieval and comprehension tasks.
